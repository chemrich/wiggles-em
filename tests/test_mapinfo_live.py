"""Live regression against real EMDB maps.

Deselected by default via the ``network`` marker, because it downloads. The
synthetic tests in ``test_mapinfo.py`` prove the parser is self-consistent;
only this file proves it agrees with reality.

    pytest -m network

Each case asserts against the value **EMDB's own API reports**, fetched in the
same run, so the test cannot drift from the archive.

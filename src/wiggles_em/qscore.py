"""Q-score — per-atom resolvability, read from a wwPDB validation file.

Q-score compares the map values around each atom against a Gaussian-like
reference for a well-resolved atom: 1 is a perfect match, values near 0 mean
the local density does not look like a resolved atom at all (Pintilie *et al.*,
*Nat Methods* 17:328–334, 2020).

The reason this is the cheapest useful tool in tier 1 is that **the values are
already published**. wwPDB validation of 3DEM entries with both a model and a
map has included Q-score since September 2023, with per-residue and per-chain
averages written into the validation mmCIF and XML. So this needs no map, no
network and no computation — it parses a file the archive already distributes
and puts it on the structure.

A global resolution number is one claim about a whole map, and readers apply it
uniformly to every atom they see. Q-score breaks that apart: it shows which
parts of the model the density actually supports.

See the Wiggles compendium entry `qscore`.

    score, and putting it on the same colour scale would assert something the

    Note the scalar field covers only the *scored* residues, and the colouring
    is scoped to them. Handing the backend a field padded with zeros for the
    unscored ones would put absent data on the scale by the back door, however

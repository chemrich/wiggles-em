"""Loading volumes into PyMOL, with the geometry and the provenance stated.

``map_info`` in :mod:`wiggles_em.mapinfo` reads a header and touches nothing.
This module is the PyMOL-facing half: it loads the volume, records where it
came from (SPEC invariant **I1**), and reports the voxel size at load time
rather than leaving it to be discovered later — see
the Wiggles compendium entry `voxel-size` for why a silently wrong voxel size is
a systematic stretch of every distance in the model.

Loader discipline, from MCPymol issue #15: verify the object actually arrived
before doing anything else, scope any cleanup to the object created here, and
return an error on an empty load rather than a success message.

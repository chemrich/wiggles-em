"""Compositional occupancy — sense 2 — from an explicit table, never inferred.

"Occupancy" names two incompatible quantities, and this module exists because
conflating them produces a viewer that lies while looking fine.

**Sense 1** is the per-atom crystallographic ``q`` in the coordinate file: what
fraction of copies have that atom at that position. That is
:mod:`wiggles_em.occupancy`, and it is already addressable in PyMOL.

**Sense 2**, here, is the fraction of *imaged particles* in which a subunit,
domain or ligand is present at all. A ligand at 40% in this sense means 40% of
complexes had it bound. It lives in method output — class populations, part
presence probabilities, a normalised local map filter — and **not in the
coordinate file.** Nothing in PyMOL represents it today.

A model can be ``q = 1.0`` at every atom, a perfectly ordinary single-conformer
deposition, while the subunit it belongs to is present in half the particles.
Sense 1 says "fully occupied". Sense 2 says "half there". Both are correct, and
they answer different questions.

**So this module never reads ``q``, and that is not an oversight to be tidied up
later.** Deriving sense 2 from sense 1 would take a number that means one thing
and present it as another, and the render would look identical either way. The
table is supplied by the caller or there is no view. A test asserts no atom
property is ever fetched here.

The two tools stay separately named forever. Every legend either one draws
states which sense it is showing — see the compendium entry
`occupancy-two-senses`.

    parse into something else and colour the wrong subunit.

    Args:
        counts: How many atoms each table selection matched, counted by the
            host before calling. An empty selection is the dangerous case — a
            viewer accepts it, colours nothing, and leaves a render that looks

        obj: The object the table's selections apply to.
        table: ``selection -> fraction``, as a dict, an inline string, or a path.
        transparency: Also make rarely-present parts transparent in proportion,
            so a half-present subunit reads as half there.

            the usual "red = more" reading, so the legend states the direction.

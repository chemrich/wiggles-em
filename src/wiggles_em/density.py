"""Showing density around a selection, with the contour level stated honestly.

Every viewer makes users hunt for a contour threshold. EMDB has been publishing
the depositor's own recommended level all along — ``map.contour_list[].level``
with ``source: AUTHOR`` — and nothing surfaces it. See
``REPOSITORIES.md``.

**The unit trap this module exists to close.** PyMOL normalises MRC/CCP4 maps
on load (``normalize_ccp4_maps``, on by default), so an ``isomesh`` level is in
**sigma**. EMDB's author contour is an **absolute** map value. They are not
interchangeable, and confusing them is not a subtle error:

======================  =================  ==================================
Entry                   Author contour     As a PyMOL level if used directly
======================  =================  ==================================
EMD-30913               0.05 absolute      0.05 sigma — contours the noise
EMD-11638               0.116 absolute     0.116 sigma — contours the noise
======================  =================  ==================================

Converted properly those are **3.16 sigma** and **4.42 sigma**. The conversion
needs the map's mean and RMS, which the MRC header carries, which is why
:func:`density_view` requires the map to have been loaded through
:func:`wiggles_em.maps.load_map`: without the header it cannot state a level in
both units, and stating one without saying which is how the mistake happens.

"""Where a volume came from — SPEC.md invariant **I1**.

A latent-traversal frame, a neural-decoder volume, a U-Net-enhanced map and a
measured reconstruction all render identically once they are an isosurface.
Provenance is the one thing an isosurface cannot show, so Wiggles carries it
alongside the volume and puts it in every readout.

**The default is UNKNOWN, and that is the whole design.** Defaulting to
"measured" would be the dangerous direction to be wrong in: it would take a
generated volume and quietly assert it was observed. So nothing here classifies
a map automatically. :func:`gather_evidence` reports what the file says about
itself and may *suggest* a category; only the caller can declare one.

See the Wiggles compendium entry `benchmarks` and
the Wiggles compendium entry `local-resolution` for why this matters.

    # measurement" says something different from SHARPENED's, and GENERATED's
    # "no particle was reconstructed into this density" is stronger than both.
    #
    # `_TOKENS`' declaration order is NOT consulted and must not be relied on:
    # it lists NN_ENHANCED before GENERATED, which is not most-cautionary-first,

    # the tokens are independent matches at different positions, and both are

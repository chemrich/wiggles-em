"""Occupancy views — **sense 1 only**, per-atom crystallographic ``q``.

These tools read the ``occupancy`` column of a coordinate file and nothing
else. They never infer, estimate or display compositional occupancy — what
fraction of imaged particles contain a subunit. That is sense 2, it lives in
method output rather than the model, and it belongs to ``composition_view`` in
tier 3.

The distinction is the single most important design decision in SPEC.md, and
the reason is that the failure is invisible: a model can be ``q = 1.0``
everywhere while its subunit is present in half the particles. Both statements
are true, they answer different questions, and a render that conflates them
looks entirely normal. So every legend these functions emit names the sense.

See the Wiggles compendium entry `occupancy-two-senses`.

"""Multi-state ensembles: spread, and morphing that refuses when ill-posed.

An ensemble and a multiconformer model both say "not one state", and they look
similar on disk, but they encode different claims. Altloc says *at this site,
these discrete alternatives, in these proportions*. Multi-model says *here are
N draws from a distribution* — the spread is the variation, no member is
privileged, and there are no occupancies at all.

These two views are for the multi-model case. Occupancy lives in
:mod:`wiggles_em.occupancy`. See the Wiggles compendium entry `multiconformer`.

No numpy: the arithmetic is a mean and a root-mean-square, and keeping tier 1
dependency-free is worth more than the vectorisation.

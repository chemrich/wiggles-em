"""Saving and restoring B-factors around views that overwrite them.

Several views colour by pushing a scalar into the B-factor column, because
that is what PyMOL's ``spectrum`` reads. It is destructive, so anything doing
it owes the user a way back.

**The values are held here, in Python, not in PyMOL.** They come free: every
view already calls :func:`wiggles_em.atoms.fetch_atoms`, and that reads ``b``.
Keeping them on this side means a restore does not depend on some PyMOL field
surviving whatever the user does to the session in between.

Restoring pushes them back in **one** command via PyMOL's ``stored`` namespace
and a single ``alter``, rather than one ``alter`` per atom — a 10,000-atom
structure would otherwise mean 10,000 round trips. This mirrors what MCPymol's
``conservation_view`` already does in production, which is the reason to
prefer it over the ``custom`` field: ``custom`` is a *string* property, so a
float pushed into it would stringify, and a view claiming "B-factors preserved"
on that basis would be asserting something it had not established.

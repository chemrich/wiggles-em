"""Stepping through a latent trajectory, without claiming what it cannot.

This is the tool the compendium is most careful about, and the care is not
decorative. The Flatiron Institute blind challenge put 41 submissions on the
same thyroglobulin data and found the field recovers **motion** well and
**populations** badly: the simulated ground truth had three modes, most
submissions recovered two, and only three of the 41 found all three. The mode
they missed was the middle one. `limits` gives the information-theoretic reason
— measurement noise sets a floor on how finely conformation space can be
resolved, and a state sandwiched between two others is what that floor eats
first.

Two SPEC invariants fall out of that, and both are enforced here.

**I2 — no unlabelled latent plot.** Every rendering names its generating method
and carries that method's caveat. The caveats are not interchangeable: cryoDRGN
latent density can bear no relation to the truth, while 3DVA frames are linear
interpolations no particle ever occupied. When
:func:`~wiggles_em.heterogeneity.load_ensemble` could not identify the
method, this **refuses to render** rather than draw an unlabelled trajectory.

**I3 — a gap is not an absence.** Nothing here may state or imply that an
unpopulated region of latent space is unvisited. :data:`ABSENCE_CLAIMS` lists
the phrasings that would breach that, and a test asserts no output contains
one. There is deliberately **no scatter plot and no density estimate** in this
tool: the single most requested latent rendering is the one the evidence says
is most often wrong, and the honest version of it is not a better-drawn plot,
it is not drawing it.

**The trap this tool exists to close.** PyMOL normalises each map independently
on load, so contouring every frame at "1.5 sigma" contours each frame at *its
own* sigma. A traversal is precisely the case where the density genuinely
changes between frames — that is the signal — and per-frame normalisation
rescales it away. Frames drawn that way look reassuringly similar no matter
what the ensemble does. So the level is fixed in **absolute** terms and
converted to each frame's own sigma, and the spread of those sigmas is reported,
because that spread *is* the density change.

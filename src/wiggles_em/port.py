"""The entire coupling surface between Wiggles and a running PyMOL.

SPEC.md §0: Wiggles talks to PyMOL through one small protocol and nothing else.
Everything above this module is pure and testable with :class:`FakePort` and no
PyMOL installed.

Two operations:

``do(command)``
    Run a PyMOL command line. Fire-and-forget; returns a status string.

``query(action, *args, **kwargs)``
    Call something on the PyMOL side and get a JSON-able value back. The shape
    is deliberately **structured rather than a string to be parsed** — it maps
    one-to-one onto the wire protocol's ``{action, args, kwargs}``, so no
    adapter has to reverse-engineer an expression.

Two adapters implement that protocol, and inside MCPymol only one of them is
used. :class:`SendRequestPort` wraps :func:`mcpymol.bridge.send_request`, which
already speaks the wire — reimplementing it here would be two sources of truth
for one socket.

:class:`BridgePort` is the other, and it stays. It speaks the protocol directly
over the standard library without importing ``mcpymol``, which is what makes
this package runnable on its own, and it is what the Wiggles live-fire harness
drives. :func:`interpret` is shared by both, so a response translates
identically whichever one is in play — asserted by a test, because if they
diverge the behaviour depends on how the code happens to be installed.

Per-atom queries need the ``iterate_to_list`` plugin action. It is on
``mcpymol.plugin`` as of PR #41 and is load-bearing for MCPymol's own
``atom_properties`` tool as well as for everything here — see
:data:`ITERATE_TO_LIST`.

"""Reading a heterogeneity job directory: ordered volumes, latents, and a method.

Every method in this space — cryoDRGN, 3DVA, RECOVAR, 3DFlex, DynaMight — puts
essentially the same thing on disk: **a directory of maps plus a table of latent
coordinates.** RECOVAR's own documentation says so in those words. So one reader
covers them, with per-method detection in front of it.

**Why the method name is load-bearing rather than cosmetic.** SPEC invariant
**I2** forbids an unlabelled latent rendering: every latent view has to name the
method that generated it and carry that method's interpretive caveat, because
the caveats are not interchangeable. cryoDRGN's latent *density* can bear no
relation to the truth; 3DVA's frames are linear interpolations that no particle
ever occupied. A viewer that draws both the same way is asserting something for
one of them that only holds for the other. So :func:`load_ensemble` identifies
the method, and :mod:`wiggles_em.latent` **refuses to render** when it
could not.

**Detection is evidence-based and never a guess.** Each method is recognised by
markers its own documentation describes — cryoDRGN's ``z.pkl`` beside a
``config.yaml``, RELION's STAR files, cryoSPARC's ``.cs`` files. Anything else
loads its volumes perfectly well and stays ``UNKNOWN``, and the report says what
was looked for and what was found. That is not a failure mode; it is I2 working.
The caller who knows what they ran can pass ``method=`` and say so.

**Provenance.** Volumes in a heterogeneity job are decoder output or subspace
interpolations — nothing observed exactly that density. :func:`load_ensemble`
therefore declares :data:`~wiggles_em.provenance.Provenance.GENERATED`
rather than leaving them ``UNKNOWN``, and the report states that it did so and
on what evidence. This is not the inference I1 forbids: I1 exists to stop a
generated volume being asserted as *measured*, and this asserts the opposite,
conservative direction. An explicit ``provenance=`` still wins.

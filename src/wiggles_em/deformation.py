"""Per-atom displacement between conformations: the well-supported claim.

Of everything cryo-EM heterogeneity methods produce, **motion is the part that
survives blind testing.** The Flatiron challenge put 41 submissions on the same
data and reported that the molecular motions they identified resembled both each
other and the ground truth; it was the *population distributions* that fell
apart. So this tool is built with confidence, and its legend says what it is
showing rather than hedging it into uselessness.

That confidence is bounded in one specific way. A displacement field is a
statement about **where density moved**, not about how many particles moved that
way. Nothing here reports a population, and the legend says so — the honesty
problem in this corner of the field is not that motion is overclaimed, it is
that motion and population get drawn with the same confidence.

**Half-set uncertainty.** DynaMight estimates deformations twice, on independent
half-sets, and the disagreement between them is the only per-position signal of
how much any individual arrow can be trusted. When that table is supplied the
arrows are coloured by it. When it is not, the report says so loudly rather than
drawing uniformly confident arrows over a field that has none — an arrow looks
exactly as convincing either way, which is the whole problem.
